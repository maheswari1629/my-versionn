**Hackathon**

**Devops**: Development + Operations

\*Developers(who write a code)

\*operations(who deploy/manage system)

-->work together. instead of working in silos.



--\*Real Time Example--



imagine you're building a mobile app like swiggy.



* The developer write a code to add "Track my order" Features.
* without devops: developer gives code to Ops team -->they ,manuaaly deploy-->bugs happen-->delays.
* With devops: Code is Automatically tested and deployed -->Customers get updates Faster and Safely.





**Develops helps you:**



* **Release features Faster(like adding new payment method in Zomato)**
* **Fix bugs quickly(like fixing login issue in IRCTC)**
* **Automate repetitive tasks(like server restarts, database backups)**





**Eight stages of development**



* **PLAN(Define what to build)**
* **DEVELOP(Write the code)**
* **BUILD(Compile code into deployable format)**
* **TEST(Check for bugs automatically)**
* **RELEASE(approve the build for deployment)**
* **DELPOY(push app to server for app store)**
* **OPERATE(keep app running, fix any issues)**
* **MONITOR(analyze performance and feedback)**





**GitHub Basics:**



* **Git = Version control System(local)**

* **GitHub = Online platform to store Git Projects**
